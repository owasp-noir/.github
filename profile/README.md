## 🚀 Key Features:

- Automatic identification of language and framework from source code.
- Uncover API endpoints and web pages with code analysis.
- Lightning-fast results integration with proxy tools like ZAP, Burpsuite, Caido, and more.
- Structured data output in JSON and YAML for seamless collaboration with other tools.
- Command line samples provided for easy integration with tools like cURL and HTTPie.
