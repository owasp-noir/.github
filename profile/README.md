## 🔍 What is Noir?

OWASP Noir is an open-source attack surface discovery tool that automatically finds every endpoint in your codebase by combining precise static code analysis with AI.
It reveals shadow APIs, undocumented routes, and hidden vulnerabilities that traditional tools and manual methods consistently miss — giving security teams and developers complete, accurate visibility into the real attack surface.

## 🚀 Key Features:

- Attack Surface Discovery: Analyzes source code to identify your application's complete attack surface, including hidden endpoints, shadow APIs, and other security blind spots.
- AI-Powered Analysis: Leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect endpoints in any language or framework—even those not natively supported.
- SAST-to-DAST Bridge: Connects static code analysis with dynamic testing by providing discovered endpoints to DAST tools, enabling more comprehensive and accurate security scans.
- DevSecOps Ready: Designed for seamless integration into security pipelines with support for tools like ZAP, Burp Suite, Caido, and more.
- Multi-Format Output: Delivers results in JSON, YAML, OpenAPI Specification, and other formats for easy integration with your existing workflow.
